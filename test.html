      Your live feeds, queries and personalized settings are strictly your business. We have the utmost respect for your privacy in this increasingly open world. Whether you access the Sentry interface from inside your local network or you come in over the internet, your data is protected. All data stored on and in transit to/from the Sentry AIM is encrypted with keys stored on your device and your phone. Our servers will work with only encrypted data.

Unlike comparable systems, users have the option to keep their data 100% local. This means all processing is done on the device and your data never reaches our servers! You own your data, you should be in control where it goes.
